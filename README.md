# PREDICTING DIABETES WITH MACHINE LEARNING

When your ML model is 'enough good'? 
When a Mean Absolute Error is 'enough good'? Is this the only metric we can use to evaluate an ML model?

In this repository I've analyzed the 'diabetes dataset', comparing different models to understand how a ML model can be considered
'enough good', based on the metrics.

It came out a little long work and I decided to write an article, divided in two parts, to better explaining the analysis I made in this repo.

You can find the first part [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/predicting-diabetes-with-machine-learning-part-i-f151cb764aee)

> **NOTE**: I've created a standard for my plots so I've created a custom module called `plots.py` and it is in the `custom_functions` folder in this repository. \
> If you want to learn more about it, you can see the whole code [here](https://github.com/federico-trotta/plots_custom_functions/tree/main)

## The main idea behind this project
If you are not "a technician" or if you just want to understand the main concepts without reading the code, you can take a look at the PDF I created:

- [here](https://github.com/federico-trotta/predicting_diabetes_with_ML/blob/main/PDF/ITALIAN/diabetes%20predictions.pdf) you find the Italian version
- [here](https://github.com/federico-trotta/predicting_diabetes_with_ML/blob/main/PDF/ENGLISH/predicting%20diabetes%20with%20ML.pdf) you find the English version
