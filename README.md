PREDICTING DIABETES WITH MACHINE LEARNING

When your ML model is 'enough good'? 
When a Mean Absolute Error is 'enough good'? Is this the only metric we can use to evaluate a ML model?

In this repository I've analized the 'diabetes dataset' comparing different models to understand how a ML model can be considered
'enough good', buased on the metrics.

It came out a little long work and I decided to write an article, divided in two parts, to better epxpplaining the analysis I made.

You can find the first part here:
