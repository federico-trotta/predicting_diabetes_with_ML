# PREDICTING DIABETES WITH MACHINE LEARNING

When your ML model is 'enough good'? 
When a Mean Absolute Error is 'enough good'? Is this the only metric we can use to evaluate a ML model?

In this repository I've analized the 'diabetes dataset', comparing different models to understand how a ML model can be considered
'enough good', based on the metrics.

It came out a little long work and I decided to write an article, divided in two parts, to better explaining the analysis I made in this repo.

You can find the first part [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/predicting-diabetes-with-machine-learning-part-i-f151cb764aee)

The second part is [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/predicting-diabetes-with-machine-learning-part-ii-a6f703e8cf04)

Recently, I've created a standard for my plots so I've create a custom module called 'plots.py' and it is in the 'custom_functions' folder in this repository.
In this project I use this module ad it is imported at the beginning of the Notebook.
If you want to undestand more (maybe, because you do not uderstand how I made some plots in this Notebook), you can see the whole code [here](https://github.com/federico-trotta/plots_custom_functions/tree/main)

## The main idea behind this project
If you are not "a technician" or if you just want to understand the main concepts without reading the code, you can take a look at the PDF I created:

- [here](https://github.com/federico-trotta/predicting_diabetes_with_ML/blob/main/PDF/ITALIAN/diabetes%20predictions.pdf) you find the italian version
- [here](https://github.com/federico-trotta/predicting_diabetes_with_ML/blob/main/PDF/ENGLISH/predicting%20diabetes%20with%20ML.pdf) you find the english version
