# PREDICTING DIABETES WITH MACHINE LEARNING

When your ML model is 'enough good'? 
When a Mean Absolute Error is 'enough good'? Is this the only metric we can use to evaluate a ML model?

In this repository I've analized the 'diabetes dataset', comparing different models to understand how a ML model can be considered
'enough good', based on the metrics.

It came out a little long work and I decided to write an article, divided in two parts, to better explaining the analysis I made in this repo.

You can find the first part [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/predicting-diabetes-with-machine-learning-part-i-f151cb764aee)
